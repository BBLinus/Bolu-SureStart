# My learning experience as a Machine Learning Trainee at SureStart
This repo showcases my 6-week learning experience as a [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) Machine Learning trainee Spring Cohort 2021.
I was exposed to deep learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Autoencoders among others.
Kindly find in the [wiki](https://github.com/BBLinus/Bolu-SureStart/wiki) an account of my daily experience during the program
